# Software Development Intern Resume Writing 

## Sections

### 0. Personal Information

Provide your name, location (City, Province), contact information (phone number and email). You may provide links to your LinkedIn, Github and personal porfolio as well.

### 1. Objective / Profile Summary (Optional)

Providing a profile summary is totally optional and personally I do **NOT** recommend writing one (or a long one). You may write one or two sentence summarizing your profile but please do not go too long.

### 2. Skills or Technical Skills

This section highlights your skill sets, which may include techinical skills and soft skills.

If you only include techincal skills, name this section **Technical Skills**. If you are including soft skills, name this section **Skills*

This section is usually presented using bullet points. Below is an example:


**Skills**

-----

- **Language**: Python, Javascript, C/C++, HTML/CSS, C#, SQL
- **Tools & Frameworks**: Angular, React, PostMan, MongoDB, Docker
- **Soft Skills**: leadership, communication, problem-solving

<br />

**NOTE**: the language list is **ORDERED** by proficiency (High to low).

### 3. Education

In this section, you may list any post-secondary education, including certificate programs (better be relevant) or degree programs.

In addition, list out any honour and award that you have earned, as well as GPA or Cumulative GPA (if you haven't graduated).

More important, this is also where you list **Relevant Courses**. (Courses that are related to the job you are applying for)

Here is an example:

**Education**
----
**Bachelor of Engineering: Software Engineering**   &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;  Expected Graduation: Aug, 2025

*Seneca College* &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;&emsp; &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; Award1, Honour1, CGPA: 4.0

**Relevant Coursework**: Web Programming, Machine Learning, Opearating System


<br>

Depending on you, relevant courses can be listed in many ways, you may want to group them:

**Programming**: CourseA, CourseB, CourseC

**Engineering**: Eng1, Eng2, Eng3

Either way, keep in mind that do not include too many courses. Only include those ones that are relevant to the job or the ones that would make you stand out. You may want to include links your course projects here. For example:

**Programming**: CourseA, CourseB, CourseC [(Course Project)]()


### 4. Experience

This section includes your **relevant** experiences, which may include volunteering work. For example:


**Experience**

**Research Assistant** &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; Feb 2024 - Present

*Seneca College*

- what you do, somethine measureable.
- what you accomplished using what ...

Things to keep in mind:

1. Something measurable is alway preferred. Such as 'Wrote algorithm to improve the system performance by 20%'.

2. Make sure you use the correct tense. For past jobs, always use past tense. For present jobs, use present tense.

3. I do **NOT** recommend putting irrelevant jobs even if you think there are transferable non-techinical skills such as Manger at a resaturant.

4. For not so relevant jobs, such as Research Assistant or Engineering Society Executive, condense everything to 2 to 3 bullet points. (Better to be 2, max max 3)

### 5. Projects

You might have built different projects using different stacks. However, in this section, you might want to categorize and prioritize your projects.

- **Categorize:** categorize your projcets by stacks or technologies. For example, you may have AI projects built using python, web projects using javascript. So, when you apply for AI jobs, include the AI projects, and similarly, when you apply for Web development jobs, include your web projects.

- **Prioritize:** Although you may want to showcase all of your projects, usually it is not a good idea to include all of them. I would say, only include your best ones. Ideally, projects listed in this section should be industry level. For instance, a project that has well-designed architecture, and leverages load balancing, cache, cloud computing and is deployed. However, for interns, we usually do not have experiences in those kind of project. (So you may want to start building something over the summer.) Thus, I would recommend only showcasing your top projects.

In addition, include a demo, live, or github links to your projects.

Example 1:

**PROJECTS**

**Zillow Web Crawler (Python Scrapy, HTML, XPath)** &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; Nov 2020

- Implemented a web crawler using Python Scrapy to get all the homes which were listed for sale in the Bay Area
- Investigated the HTML pages to find the elements and create a field for each element in the Item Class
- Modified the setting file in the framework according to the robots.txt in Zillow
- Implemented the spider to parse elements with XPath and save the results in the Item object recursively
- Wrote all the data in the Item object to a CSV file which consisted of fourteen features and more than 5k homes

<br>

Example 2:

**PROJECTS**

**Ticket Hub - Web App** [*(Link)*]()  &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; Oct 2022

• Designed and developed a ticket sales system using **Flask** serving as the backend with **Jinja** as the frontend

• Designed and implemented the database schema using **SQLite**

• Implemented a CLI for admin system management in **Python** and integrated **Stripe**

<br>

In the first example, the tech stacks are listed next to the project. In the second example, those are bolded in the project description.

Depending on how much stuff you have on your resume, you may list more bullet points or less, but try to keep it no more than 3.

If you don't have personal projects, you may want to list your course projects here. But if you do have your personal projects, list them here and include your assignment projects in the **Relevant Course** section.


## General, Styles & Format

1. Do **NOT** use table!!!! Your resume will be read by some software first, table format will likely to mess up the content!!

2. Use doc/docx. If some platform required pdf, you can always convert it to pdf.

3. Make sure that there is **NO ERROR in SPELLING or GRAMMAR**.

4. In terms of section ordering, experienced developers will put Experience or Employment first. However, as an intern, put your skills and education first.

5. **ONE PAGE** only! If you have more than one page, condense your content! Unless you have lots of experience, but if you did, you wouldn't be reading this document.

6. Styles: the resume below is a good example. Notice that the first letter of the section is bigger than the rest? Notice the proper use of **bolded text**? You may wanna use *italic* as well for, say, school name or company name. In addition, don't use fonts that are too stylish!!! Use normal fonts such as Arial, Times New Roman, Calibri.

7. Format: refer to the resume below for formating yours. Sections go from top to bottom. Do **NOT** use fancy formatting such as a top header, then the main content is split into left and right sections.
